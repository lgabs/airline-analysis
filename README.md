# airline-analysis
Analysis of Azul's network level of concentration using main statistical metrics. 

## Introduction
This repo contains several codes used to analyze Azul's network in terms of concentration only from a spatial approach. The poster (.pdf) attached in this repo resumes this project, which was part of a brief research done while I was on an intership in Surrey University, UK, mentored by Dr. Zheng Lei. The data used to draw conclusions was provided by the professor.
Feel free to see the poster conclusions and the pictures generated in Matlab.
